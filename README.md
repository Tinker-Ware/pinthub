# PintHub

**TODO: Add description**

Still in development, I will add only the endpoints I need at first, later will add more, depending on my available time, feel free to contribute.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add pinthub to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:pinthub, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure pinthub is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:pinthub]]
        end
